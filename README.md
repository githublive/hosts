No more ads, tracking and other virtual garbage

This repository provides a host and domainname based blocklist specifically designed for use with dnsmasq. Most entries are gathered from multiple, actively maintained sources and automatically updated, cleaned, optimized and moderated on a daily basis.

The optimizer makes full use of dnsmasqs capability to block entire domains such as *.doubleclick.net (domains.txt). This reduces the chance of missing any new subdomains and significantly reduces the size of the blocklists. Hostnames that cannot be blocked on a domain level will still be listed in a regular hostname based blocklist (hostnames.txt).

It's important to use both these blocklists simultaniously to get full coverage against the contaminated parts of the internet.

How to install

For a pi-hole setup

Unfortunately pi-hole currently does not provide an easy way to use dnsmasqs 'conf-file' feature, making the key feature of this blocklist (blocking domains) useless, see this post for more info. At this moment it is recommended to set up you own dnsmasq configuration to make full use of these blocklists.

For any other dnsmasq setup

Download the following two files
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/notracking/hosts-blocklists/master/hostnames.txt
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/notracking/hosts-blocklists/master/domains.txt
Add the following lines to your dnsmasq.conf
conf-file=/path/to/domains.txt
addn-hosts=/path/to/hostnames.txt
Restart dnsmasq sudo service dnsmasq restart
